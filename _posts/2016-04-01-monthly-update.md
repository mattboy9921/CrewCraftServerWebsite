Spring is coming about. Nicer weather, no more snow days for us. Along with the changing weather, we also have a few server changes. Minecraft 1.9 has been released and we have switched to Paper Spigot which is a special fork of Spigot with more optimizations.<!--more--> This will not affect your playing experience as our goal is still vanilla style gameplay. All plugins have been updated or removed if incompatible to ensure an error free server. We are currently looking for a replacement AFK/Sleep plugin to replace the now obsolete plugin we had prior to 1.9.
