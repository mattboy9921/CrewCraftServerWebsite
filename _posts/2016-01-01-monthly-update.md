Welcome to the new year! With the 1.9 combat update just around the corner, the server has undergone many changes this month. New procedures are put into place to minimize outages to provide players with the 24/7 uptime promise we gaurantee.<!--more--> The Citizens plugin may be implimented this month providing it is compatible and works properly. We also try to keep your experience 100% Mindcrack style vanilla. This means no plugins that alter gameplay. Citizens can be used just to enhance gameplay by adding NPCs around spawn and such.

Lastly, we have been toying with the idea of opening the server to anyone wishing to join from the internet. We feel as though that might add some much needed activity to the server and make it more fun to play. However, a good process in which to interview and accept new members is still being drawn up so in due time, we shall see what happens.
