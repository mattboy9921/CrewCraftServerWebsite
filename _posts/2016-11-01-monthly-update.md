Wow a lot has happened! As a small team, sometimes we forget to update this page. Regardless, the AFK/Sleep plugin from April has been modified in house to work with the latest version.<!--more--> A SkipNight voting system is in place now as well. 1.10 has come out and now 1.11. We are working diligently to upgrade to 1.11 but we are taking this opporitunity to switch our servers from Windows based to Linux based. This means better reliablity and more robust servers. Stay tuned in December when we defeat the Wither on Minecraft 1.11 hosted on a Linux server!
