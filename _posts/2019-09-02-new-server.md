As many of you have probably noticed, the 1.14 update for the Crew Craft Server has been taking considerably long after the initial patch release. This is not due to laziness though, in fact, the CCS team have been hard at work not only to update to 1.14, but to bring a new surprise for everyone.<!--more-->

We are starting a new world! For the last 5 and a half years, CCS has had the same world that was generated way back in Minecraft 1.7. But don’t worry, this world isn’t going anywhere and the server it runs on isn’t either. 

The idea of a map reset has always been a no from me. I always disliked them on any server I played on as it would discourage players from continuing their projects or even hanging out until the reset because why put effort into something that would just be deleted. I've always followed that ideal to never reset the server but instead, a new idea has emerged. 

The Crew Craft Server will not be reset. It will be updated to 1.14. Alongside the server will be a new server, "Crew Craft 2.0" if you will, that will launch with a world generated on 1.14. This brings about new opportunities to create a fantastic spawn, nether hub and community projects. Our hope is to bring the community together and grow the server. We hope that you are as excited as we are to get on this fresh map as we are.
