Clearly this post every month thing isn't working out. Anyway, news from the Crew Craft Server is back. The server has been upgraded once more and development has given us a more robust activity/sleep plugin.<!--more--> Skipnight will be getting an overhaul in the coming weeks too! We have added craftable mini blocks (themed player heads) that can add a bit of variety and creativity to your builds. In other news, we have opened up our server to the masses. A new forum post has been created welcoming new members to the server in hopes to expand our community.
