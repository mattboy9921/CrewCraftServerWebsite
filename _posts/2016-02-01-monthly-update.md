description: Technical difficulties! The server's storage solution is acting up, causing uptime to suffer. Active player count is up though, so that's nice.

So far, this month has been quite challenging. Technical difficulties have really affected things around here; mainly server uptime. Basically, the hard drive (SSD) the server runs on is acting up.<!--more--> We moved the server to a mechanical drive which is slower, but more reliable. Testing will prove if new components are necessary or if we can just replace the drive.

In other news, we are pleased to report that the server now have many new active members which contributes to keeping the server up and running. We are glad people take time out of their day to visit the server and play together. Happy Valentine's Day and enjoy your stay!
